# ALGORITHMS 4

## Pseudo Code

1. Pseudo code is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorithm.

2. Simply we can say that it s the cooked up representation of an algorithm.

3. Often at times, algorithms are represented with the help of pseudo codes as they
can be interpreted by programmers no matter what their programming background
or knowledge is

4. Pseudo code, as the name suggests, is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood by even a layman with some school level programming knowledge.

5. It’s simply an implementation of an algorithm in the form of annotations and
informative text written in plain English.

6. It has no syntax like any of the programming language and thus can’t be compiled or
interpreted by the computer.

## Advantages of Pseudocode 

#### The following are the factors that we need to consider for designing an algorithm:

1. Improves the readability of any approach. It’s one of the best approaches to start
implementation of an algorithm.

2. Acts as a bridge between the program and the algorithm or flowchart. Also works as a rough documentation, so the program of one developer can be understood easily when a pseudo code is written out. In industries, the approach of documentation is essential. And that’s where a pseudo code proves vital.

3. The main goal of a pseudo code is to explain what exactly each line of a program should do, hence making the code construction phase easier for the programmer.

## Disadvantages of Pseudocode

1. Pseudocode does not provide a visual representation of the logic of programming.

2. There are no proper format for writing the for pseudocode.

3. In Pseudocode their is extra need of maintain documentation.

4. In Pseudocode their is no proper standard very company follow their own standard for writing the pseudocode.
