# ALGORITHMS 6

## Algorithm Analysis

1. The algorithm can be analyzed in two levels, i.e., first is before creating the algorithm,
and second is after creating the algorithm.

2. The following are the two analysis of an algorithm:

### Priori Analysis:

1. Here , priori analysis is the theoretical analysis of an algorithm which is done before
implementing the algorithm.

2. Various factors can be considered before implementing the algorithm like processor
speed, which has no effect on the implementation part.

### Posterior Analysis:

1. Here , posterior analysis is a practical analysis of an algorithm.

2. The practical analysis is achieved by implementing the algorithm using any programming
language.

3. This analysis basically evaluate that how much running time and space taken by the
algorithm.
