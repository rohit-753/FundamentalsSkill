# ALGORITHMS 7

## Algorithm Complexity

The performance of the algorithm can be measured in two factors:


### Time complexity:

1. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time required to complete the
execution.

2. The time complexity of an algorithm is denoted by the big O notation.

3. Here , big O notation is the asymptotic notation to represent the time complexity.

4. The time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish
the execution.


### Space complexity:

1. An algorithm's space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem
and produce an output.

2. Similar to the time complexity, space complexity is also expressed in big O notation.

3. For an algorithm, the space is required for the following purposes:

    - To store program instructions
    - To store constant values
    - To store variable values
    - To track the function calls, jumping statements, etc.

4. Auxiliary space: The extra space required by the algorithm, excluding the input size,
is known as an auxiliary space. The space complexity considers both the spaces, i.e., auxiliary space, and space used by the input.

5. So , Space complexity = Auxiliary space + Input size.
