# ALGORITHMS 2

## Dataflow of an Algorithm
1. Problem: A problem can be a real world problem or any instance from the real world
problem for which we need to create a program or the set of instructions. The set of
instructions is known as an algorithm.

2. Algorithm: An algorithm will be designed for a problem which is a step by step
procedure.

3. Input: After designing an algorithm, the required and the desired inputs are provided
to the algorithm.

4. Processing unit: The input will be given to the processing unit, and the processing
unit will produce the desired output.

5. Output: The output is the outcome or the result of the program.

## Why do we need Algorithms?

1. Scalability: It helps us to understand the scalability. When we have a big real world
problem, we need to scale it down into small small steps to easily analyze the
problem.

2. Performance: The real world is not easily broken down into smaller steps. If the
problem can be easily broken into smaller steps means that the problem is feasible.

## Advantages of an Algorithm

1. Effective Communication: Since it is written in a natural language like English, it
becomes easy to understand the step by step delineation of a solution to any
particular problem.

2. Easy Debugging: A well designed algorithm facilitates easy debugging to detect the
logical errors that occurred inside the program.

3. Easy and Efficient Coding: An algorithm is nothing but a blueprint of a program that
helps develop a program.

4. Independent of Programming Language: Since it is a language independent, it can
be easily coded by incorporating any high level language.

## Disadvantages of an Algorithm

1. Developing algorithms for complex problems would be time consuming and difficult
to understand.

2. It is a challenging task to understand complex logic through algorithms.
