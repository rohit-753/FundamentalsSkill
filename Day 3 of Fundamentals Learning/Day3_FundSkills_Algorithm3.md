# ALGORITHMS 3

## How to Design an Algorithm?

#### In order to write an algorithm, following things are needed as a prerequisite:

1. The problem that is to be solved by this algorithm.

2. The constraints of the problem that must be considered while solving the
problem.

3. The input to be taken to solve the problem.

4. The output to be expected when the problem the is solved.

5. The solution to this problem, in the given constraints

## Factors of an Algorithm 

#### The following are the factors that we need to consider for designing an algorithm:

1. Modularity: If any problem is given and we can break that problem into small small
modules or small small steps, which is a basic definition of an algorithm, it means
that this feature has been perfectly designed for the algorithm.

2. Correctness: The correctness of an algorithm is defined as when the given inputs
produce the desired output, which means that the algorithm has been designed
algorithm. The analysis of an algorithm has been done correctly.

3. Maintainability: Here, maintainability means that the algorithm should be designed
in a very simple structured way so that when we redefine the algorithm, no major
change will be done in the algorithm.

4. Functionality: It considers various logical steps to solve the real world problem.

5. Robustness: Robustness means that how an algorithm can clearly define our
problem.

6. User friendly: If the algorithm is not user friendly, then the designer will not be able
to explain it to the programmer.

7. Simplicity: If the algorithm is simple then it is easy to understand.

8. Extensibility: If any other algorithm designer or programmer wants to use your
algorithm then it should be extensible


## Importance of Algorithms

1. Theoretical importance: When any real world problem is given to us and we break
the problem into small small modules. To break down the problem, we should know
all the theoretical aspects.

2. Practical importance: As we know that theory cannot be completed without the
practical implementation. So, the importance of algorithm can be considered as
both theoretical and practical
